### Organize your business! Exploit human resources that can be used in other tasks more efficiently.

**Easy!Appointments** is a highly customizable web application that allows your customers to book
appointments with you via the web. Moreover, it provides the ability to sync your data with
Google Calendar so you can use them with other services. It is an open source project and you
can download and install it **even for commercial use**. Easy!Appointments will run smoothly with
your existing website, because it can be installed in a single folder of the server and of course,
both sites can share the same database.
